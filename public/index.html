        <h3>What Is Backend Architecture?</h3>
        <p>
            Backend architecture is the structural design and organization of the server-side
            components of an application. It encompasses everything from databases, servers, APIs,
            and business logic to security protocols and server configurations. These elements work
            together to process data, manage storage, ensure security, and enable communication with
            the frontend. This architecture dictates how components interact and function, ensuring
            seamless data flow, optimal resource utilization, and effective communication between
            different parts of your system. A well-designed backend architecture is responsible for
            ensuring the application functions efficiently, securely, and can scale with increasing
            demands, ultimately delivering a superior user experience.

        <h3>What is DevOps?</h3>
        <p>
            DevOps is a set of practices and tools that integrate software development (Dev) and IT
            operations (Ops) to streamline the development lifecycle. It focuses on automation,
            continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD), collaboration between teams, and real-time
            monitoring. DevOps enhances efficiency, reduces errors, and enables faster, more
            reliable software releases.

        <h3>What is Solana?</h3>
        <p>
            Solana is a high-performance blockchain designed for decentralized applications (dApps)
            with fast transaction speeds and low fees. It uses a unique Proof of History (PoH)
            consensus mechanism, allowing it to process up to 65,000 transactions per second.
            Solana’s architecture is highly scalable and does not require layer-2 solutions, making
            it ideal for applications like DeFi, gaming, and NFTs.
